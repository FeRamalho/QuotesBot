I need two tickets in the orchestra section for Wicked.
But last night, I embraced who I am and I don't want to stop. 
Oh, my God, you're a lesbian.
I can do a car chase!
A female superhero. Shouldn't she be called Superwoman?
So if you perceive “Supergirl” as anything less than excellent, isn't the real problem you?
Be wise, be strong and always be true to yourself.
Meet me on the roof.
I want a sit down with Supergirl. A girl to girl.
I got some mad sewing skills.
I'm allowed to have friends, aren't I?
But I'm not a scared little girl anymore.
Supergirl will find me.
